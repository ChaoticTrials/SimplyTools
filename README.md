Simply Tools is the successor of the mods [Vanilla Hammers](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-hammers)
combined with [Vanilla Excavators](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-excavators). These tools can mine in a 3x3 area.
Hammers for blocks like stones, and excavators for blocks like dirt. The two base mods started as a port from the Fabric 
version, which you can find here ([Hammers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-hammers))
and here ([Excavators](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-excavators)).
